Hi, I’m @Maria-Lara-Delpiano, I have a degree in molecular biotechnology and
I ´m  particularly interested  about technological innovation,
 information processing and biomedical research. 
I am currently learning about 3D printing, and I hope the materials I have
uploaded to my repositories on this topic are helpful for you.
